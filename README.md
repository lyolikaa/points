The user selects four arbitrary points (A, B, C, D) in the client area of the browser. When they are selected, the program highlights their location by constructing black circles with a diameter of 5 pixels for each selected point.

Based on these four points, two shapes need to be constructed:

a blue circle with center at point A, whose radius is equal to the distance from point A to point B;

a yellow circle with center at point C, whose radius is equal to the distance from point C to point D;

The coordinates of the selected points, as well as the coordinates of the intersection points of the two circles, should be presented to the user numerically.

The user should be free to move the points in the screen area at any time. Moving the points changes the image of the circles accordingly and displays the updated shapes, their coordinates.

A "reset" function, which clears the area and allows the user to select four new points and repeat the entire process described above.

The "about" function, which specifies your own information about the program, its author, and instructions for using it.
